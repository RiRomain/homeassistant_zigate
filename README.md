Example config for a xiaomi\_aqara temperature sensor :
- __address is on 6 bytes : 4 corresponding to short\_address and 2 to the endpoint\_id__
- temperature is registered as the default value for the sensor (which grabs temperature, pressure & humidity). Any attribute declared for the sensor can be chosen as default attribute
- pressure is made available in the interface / history / graphs through a template
- address is the short address of the Zigbee component (previously registered)
